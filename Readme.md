# 100xDevs 2.0 (JavaScript Assignments)

You are provided empty JavaScript files (or having function signatures) in this directory. 
You have to follow the instructions given in each file and write the code in the same file to complete the assignment.

## Assignments
Feel free to start doing these in any order you like.
1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard

## Testing
1. Follow the comment above each problem to run test for that problem
3. To tests for all the problems run
```bash
     npm run all
  ```   
## Development Setup
1. If you have Node.js locally, you should run these on your machine 
2. If you don't, you can copy these over to repl.it and run it there. Tests wont be automated there so you will have to make use judgement to ensure if your code is correct

If you have Node.js installed locally, run these assignments on your machine.
If you don't have Node.js locally, you can copy the files to repl.it and run them there. Note that tests won't be automated in repl.it, so you'll need to use your judgment to ensure your code is correct.

#### Instructions for Running Tests
 **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:me-imfhd/week-1-assignment.git
```
**Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and npx installed:**
  Install Jest globally using the following command:
   ```bash
     npm install -g jest
  ```
(Note: Do not run npm install anywhere.)

**Install Jest as a Dependency (if not installed globally):**
 ```bash
     npm install jest
  ```

**To run tests for a specific assignment, use the following command:**
```bash
     npm run <name>
  ```
Example:
```bash
     npm run palindrome
  ```
The working directory should be the root directory of the cloned repository.

**Jest CLI Check**
To check if the Jest CLI is installed, run the following command:
```bash
     npx jest --version
  ```
Good luck with your JavaScript assignments!
